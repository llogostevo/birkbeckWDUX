                    <blockquote>"...a world class curriculum for the students: whilst based around traditional subjects it must reflect the world as it is today and prepare the students for the future"</blockquote>

                    <p>This part of the mission statement led to the formation of Silicon Hack. Working under the umbrella of Central Foundation Boys' Schools sixth form provision we have developed a course that moves away from the traditional classroom based approach.</p>

                    <p>Here you will learn technical skills that include:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>

                        <li>Intro to Python</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>More importantly you will learn the soft skills required to progress either into University, an Apprenticeship or the workplace. Skills such as: </p>
