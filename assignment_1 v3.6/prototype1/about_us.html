            <p>At the end of KS5 you generally have two options - go to university, or go into employment. As a student who is interested in the IT sector you may choose to study a Computer Science degree. Computer Science however has the biggest drop out rate of all degrees within the UK. According to the Complete University Guide, 11 percent of students fail to complete their degree.</p>
            <p>Even if you do complete a Computer Science course you may think that you have a better chance of finding employment? The Sutton Trust Report - Earning by Degrees, 2014 outlines that Computer Science graduates "...were at relatively high risks of unemployment."</p>

                <p>The current method of computing education is flawed when it comes to post 16 study and getting students into job roles within the IT sector.</p>
                <p>Our aim at Silicon Hack is to fix it.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you want to work in the Tech Sector?</li>
                    <li>Are you aged between 16 and 18?</li>
                    <li>Are you about to choose subjects for 6th form?</li>
                    <li>Are you based in London?</li>
                    <li>Would you prefer to study as if you were in a business rather than the classroom?</li>
                    <li>If you answered yes to most of the questions above then READ ON!</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>At Silicon Hack you will learn in a Bootcamp style approach before embarking on assignments related to the field of study. A subsidiary of the computing department @ Central Foundation Boys' School we are based in the heart of Tech City. This means we are in a prime location to give you the best possible chance of progressing into a career within the Tech Sector after your studies.</p>
